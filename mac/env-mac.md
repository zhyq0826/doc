A CA file has been bootstrapped using certificates from the system
keychain. To add additional certificates, place .pem files in
 /usr/local/etc/openssl/certs

and run
 /usr/local/opt/openssl/bin/c_rehash

This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.

Apple has deprecated use of OpenSSL in favor of its own TLS and crypto libraries

Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your
own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your
build variables:

   LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib

This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.

OS X provides the BSD libedit library, which shadows libreadline.
In order to prevent conflicts when programs look for libreadline we are
defaulting this GNU Readline installation to keg-only.

If builds of PostgreSQL 9 are failing and you have version 8.x installed,
you may need to remove the previous version first. See:
 https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/issue/2510

To migrate existing data from a previous major version (pre-9.3) of PostgreSQL, see:
 http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/upgrading.html

When installing the postgres gem, including ARCHFLAGS is recommended:
 ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install pg

To install gems without sudo, see the Homebrew documentation:
https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Gems,-Eggs-and-Perl-Modules.md

To have launchd start homebrew/versions/postgresql93 at login:
 ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql93/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load homebrew/versions/postgresql93 now:
 launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql93.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
 postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres
