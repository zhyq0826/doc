# LTRIM *key* *start* *end*

**TIME COMPLEXITY**:
O(n) (with n being len of list - len of range)

**DESCRIPTION**:
Trim an existing list so that it will contain only the specified range of
elements specified. Start and end are zero-based indexes. 0 is the first
element of the list (the list head), 1 the next element and so on.

For example LTRIM foobar 0 2 will modify the list stored at foobar key so
that only the first three elements of the list will remain.

*start* and *end* can also be negative numbers indicating offsets from the
end of the list. For example -1 is the last element of the list, -2 the
penultimate element and so on.

Indexes out of range will not produce an error: if start is over the end of
the list, or start > end, an empty list is left as value. If end over the
end of the list Redis will threat it just like the last element of the list.

Hint: the obvious use of LTRIM is together with LPUSH/RPUSH. For example:

  LPUSH mylist &lt;someelement&gt; LTRIM mylist 0 99

The above two commands will push elements in the list taking care that the
list will not grow without limits. This is very useful when using Redis to
store logs for example. It is important to note that when used in this way
LTRIM is an O(1) operation because in the average case just one element is
removed from the tail of the list.

**RETURN VALUE**:
Status code reply.
