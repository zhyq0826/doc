# DECRBY key integer

**TIME COMPLEXITY**:
O(1)

**DESCRIPTION**: Increment or decrement the number stored at key by one. If the
key does not exist or contains a value of a wrong type, set the key to the
value of "0" before to perform the increment or decrement operation.

INCRBY and DECRBY work just like INCR and DECR but instead to
increment/decrement by 1 the increment/decrement is integer.

INCR commands are limited to 64 bit signed integers.

**RETURN VALUE**: Integer reply, this commands will reply with the new value
of key after the increment or decrement.
